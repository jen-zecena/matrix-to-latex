    <p class="lead">Perhaps the most tedious part of using LaTeX for homework assignments is representing matrices. This work attempts to address this by allowing users to convert images of handwritten matrices to LaTeX code that can be copied and pasted into their own LaTeX editors. This is achieved through the use of the YOLOv5 object recognition model to classify and locate the matrix elements and a simple algorithm taking advantage of a matrixâ€™s grid-like structure to generate the LaTeX code. </p>
